# Project Description
The goal of this website is to showcase the skills I have gotten during the CSS course.

For this reason I have built and deploy a protfolio website.

This one is composed of:

* Navigation Header
* Sidebar Section
    * About Me Article
    * Contact Me Article
* Projects Section
* Footer Section

It has a top and bottom navigation bar in the header section with links to the "About Me" and "Contact Me" articles, "Work" section and to the begining of the website ("Resume").

This website is responsive for mobile devices.

I also added a Switch Toggle ![](./assets/images/toggle-switch.png) for change website appearence color (just for fun).
